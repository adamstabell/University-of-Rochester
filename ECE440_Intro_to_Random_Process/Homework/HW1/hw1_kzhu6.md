## Question B

```
Under 100 experiments, the probability of reaching home is 0.07
Under 400 experiments, the probability of reaching home is 0.09
Under 700 experiments, the probability of reaching home is 0.10
Under 1000 experiments, the probability of reaching home is 0.09
Under 1300 experiments, the probability of reaching home is 0.08
Under 1600 experiments, the probability of reaching home is 0.09
Under 1900 experiments, the probability of reaching home is 0.09
Under 2200 experiments, the probability of reaching home is 0.08
Under 2500 experiments, the probability of reaching home is 0.08
```

**Answer**:
I select 1000 times of experiments and I estimate the probability of reaching home to be 0.9. The reason I select N to be 1000 is after many times of experiments, I find the result becomes stable for N larger than 1000 as shown above. Therefore, I think the result converges roughly around 1000 times of experiments.

**Answer**:
Given the scenario in the graph above, where $w_0 = 10, n = max_t = 1000$
, I estimate the probability distribution of $T_0$ to be **poisson distribution** with **average value of 50.76**

## Code for Question A
**casino.m**

```matlab
function [w, t, broke] = casino(w_0, bet, p, max_t)

    % Starting time
    t = 1;
    % Boolean to indicate broke or not
    broke = 0; 
    % Wealth starts with w_0
    w(t) = w_0;
    while ( (w(t)>0) && (t<max_t) )
       % Random outcome of this bet (win or lose with probablity of p for winning)
       x = random('bino', 1, p);

       % If win, add wealth by amount of bet
       if (x==1)                     
           w(t+1) = w(t) + bet;
       % If lose, substract wealth by amount of bet
       else 
           w(t+1) = w(t) - bet;
       end
       % Increment the time counter
       t = t + 1;
    end

    % If the while loop ends before reaching the maximum play time,
    % the person must be broke
    if t < max_t
        % Change the broke to 1
        broke = 1;
